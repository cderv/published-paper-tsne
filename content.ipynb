    "\n",
    "We present a new technique called \"t-SNE\" that visualizes high-dimensional\n",
    "data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map.\n",
    "The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding\n",
    "hinton:stochastic that is much easier to optimize, and produces\n",
    "significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points\n",
    "together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at\n",
    "creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is\n",
    "particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several\n",
    "different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects\n",
    "from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the\n",
    "structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on\n",
    "neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all the data to\n",
    "influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate\n",
    "the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with\n",
    "many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping,\n",
    "Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualization produced by t-SNE are\n",
    "significantly better than those produced by other techniques on almost all of\n",

    "\n",
    "Visualization of high-dimensional data is an important problem in many\n",
    "different domains, and deals with data of widely varying dimensionality. Cell\n",
    "nuclei that are relevant to breast cancer, for example, are described by\n",
    "approximately 30 variables @street:nuclear, whereas the pixel\n",
    "intensity vectors used to represent images or the word-count vectors used to\n",
    "represent documents typically have thousands of dimensions. Over the last few\n",
    "decades, a variety of techniques for the visualization of such high-dimensional\n",
    "data have been proposed, many of which are reviewed by @ferreira:visual.\n",
    "Important techniques include iconographic displays such as Chernoff faces @chernoff:use, \n",
    "pixel-based techniques @keim:designing, and techniques that represent the dimensions in the \n",
    "data as vertices in a graph @battista:algorithms. Most of these techniques simply\n",
    "provide tools to display more than two data dimensions, and leave the\n",
    "interpretation of the data to the human observer. This severely limits the\n",
    "applicability of these techniques to real-world data sets that contain\n",
    "thousands of high-dimensional datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the visualization techniques discussed above, dimensionality\n",
    "reduction methods convert the high-dimensional data set $\\mathcal{X} = {x_1,\n",
    "x_2, \\dots, x_n}$ into two or three-dimensional data $\\mathcal{Y} = {y_1, y_2,\n",
    "\\dots, y_n}$ that can be displayed in a scatterplot. In the paper, we refer to\n",
    "the low-dimensional data representation $\\mathcal{Y}$ as a map, and to the\n",
    "low-dimensional representations $y_i$ of individual datapoints as map\n",
    "points. The aim of dimensionality reduction is to preserve as much of the\n",
    "significant structure of the high-dimensional data as possible in the\n",
    "low-dimensional map. Various techniques for this problem have been proposed\n",
    "that differ in the type of structure they preserve. Traditional dimensionality\n",
    "reduction techniques such as Principal Components Analysis\n",
    "@hotelling:analysis  and classical multidimensional scaling\n",
    "@torgerson:multidimensional are linear techniques that focus on keeping\n",
    "the low-dimensional representations of dissimilar datapoints far apart. For\n",
    "high-dimensional data that lies on or near a low-dimensional, non-linear\n",
    "manifold it is usually more important to keep the low-dimensional\n",
    "representations of very similar datapoints close together, which is typically\n",
    "not possible with a linear mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large number of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques that aim to\n",
    "preserve the local structure of data have been proposed, many of which are\n",
    "reviewed by @lee:nonlinear. In particular, we mention the following\n",

    "Maximum Variance Unfolding @weinberger:learning; (6) Locally Linear\n",
    "Embedding @roweis:nonlinear, and (7) Laplacian Eigenmaps\n",
    "@belkin:laplacian. Despite the strong performance of these techniques\n",
    "on artificial data sets, they are often not very successful at visualizing\n",
    "real, high-dimensional data. In particular, most of the techniques are not\n",
    "capable of retaining both the local and the global structure of the data in a\n",

    "Consider a set of datapoints that lie on a two-dimensional curved manifold\n",
    "which is approximately linear on a small scale, and which is embedded within a\n",
    "higher-dimensional space. It is possible to model the small pairwise distances\n",
    "between datapoints fairly well in a two-dimensional map, which is often\n",
    "illustrated on toy examples such as the \"Swiss roll\" data set. Now suppose that\n",
    "the manifold has ten intrinsic dimensions[^dataset] and is embedded within a\n",
    "space of much higher dimensionality. There are several reasons why the\n",
    "pairwise distances in a two-dimensional map cannot faithfully model distances\n",
    "between points on the ten-dimensional manifold. For instance, in ten\n",
    "dimensions, it is possible to have 11 datapoints that are mutually\n",
    "equidistant and there is no way to model this faithfully in a two-dimensional\n",
    "map. A related problem is the very different distribution of pairwise\n",
    "distances in the two spaces. The volume of a sphere centered on datapoint $i$\n",
    "scales as $r^m$, where $r$ is the radius and $m$ the dimensionality of the\n",
    "sphere. So if the datapoints are approximately uniformly distributed in the\n",
    "region around $i$ on the ten-dimensional manifold, we get the following\n",
    "\"crowding problem:\" the area of the two-dimensional map that is available to\n",
    "accommodate moderately distant datapoints will not be nearly large enough\n",
    "compared with the area available to accommodate nearby datapoints. Hence, if we\n",
    "want to model the small distances accurately in the map, most of the points\n",
    "that are at a moderate distance from datapoint $i$ will have to be placed much\n",
    "too far away in the two-dimensional map. In SNE, the spring connecting\n",
    "datapoint $i$ to each of these too-distant map points will thus exert a very\n",
    "small attractive force. Although these attractive forces are very small, the\n",
    "very large number of such forces crushes together the points in the center of\n",
    "the map, which prevents gaps from forming between the natural clusters. Note\n",
    "that the crowding problem is not specific to SNE, but that it occurs in other\n",
    "local techniques for multidimensional scaling such as Sammon mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "An attempt to address the crowding problem by adding a slight repulsion to all\n",
    "springs was presented by @cook:visualizing. The slight repulsion is\n",
    "created by introducing a uniform background model with a small mixing\n",
    "proportion, $\\rho$. So however far apart two map points are, $q_{ij}$ can\n",
    "never fall below $\\frac{2\\rho}{n(n-1)}$ (because the uniform background\n",
    "distribution is over $n(n-1)/2$ pairs). As a result, for datapoints that are\n",
    "far apart in the high-dimensional space, $q_{ij}$ will always be larger than\n",
    "$p_{ij}$, leading to a slight repulsion. This technique is called UNI-SNE and\n",
    "although it usually outperforms standard SNE, the optimization of the UNI-SNE\n",
    "cost function is tedious. The best optimization method known is to start by\n",
    "setting the background mixing proportion to zero (i.e., by performing standard\n",
    "SNE). Once the SNE cost function has been optimized using simulated annealing,\n",
    "the background mixing proportion can be increased to allow some gaps to form\n",
    "between natural clusters as shown by @cook:visualizing. Optimizing the\n",
    "UNI-SNE cost function directly does not work because two map points that are\n",
    "far apart will get almost all of their $q_{i}$ from the uniform background. So\n",
    "even if their $p_{ij}$ is large, there will be no attractive force between\n",
    "them, because a small change in their separation will have a vanishingly small\n",
    "*proportional* effect on $q_{ij}$. This means that if two parts of a cluster\n",
    "get separated early on in the optimization, there is no force to pull them\n",
    "back together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mismatched tails can compensate for mismatched dimensionalities {#sec-heavy_tail}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since symmetric SNE is actually matching the joint probabilities of pairs of\n",
    "datapoints in the high-dimensional and the low-dimensional spaces rather than\n",
    "their distances, we have a natural way of alleviating the crowing problem that\n",
    "works as follows. In the high-dimensional space, we convert distances into\n",
    "probabilities using a Gaussian distribution. In the low-dimensional map, we\n",

    "whereas negative values represent a repulsion between the two\n",
    "datapoints. From the figures, we observe two main advantages of the\n",
    "t-SNE gradient over the gradients of SNE and UNI-SNE.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the t-SNE gradient strongly repels dissimilar datapoints that are\n",
    "modeled by a small pairwise distance in the low-dimensional representation.\n",
    "SNE has such repulsion as well, but its effect is minimal compared to the\n",
    "strong attractions elsewhere in the gradient (the largest attraction in our\n",
    "graphical representation of the gradient is approximately 19, whereas the\n",
    "largest repulsion is approximately 1). In UNI-SNE, the amount of repulsion\n",
    "between dissimilar datapoints is slightly larger, however, this repulsion is\n",
    "only strong when the pairwise distance between the points in the\n",
    "low-dimensional representation is already large (which is often not the case,\n",
    "since the low-dimensional representation is initialized by sampling from a\n",
    "Gaussian with a very small variance that is centered around the origin).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, although t-SNE introduces strong repulsions between dissimilar\n",
    "datapoints that are modeled by small pairwise distances, these repulsions do\n",
    "not go to infinity. In this respect, t-SNE differs from UNI-SNE, in which the\n",
    "strength of the repulsion between very dissimilar datapoints is proportional\n",
    "to their pairwise distance in the low-dimensional map, which may cause\n",
    "dissimilar datapoints to move much too far away from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, t-SNE puts emphasis on (1) modeling dissimilar\n",
    "datapoints by means of large pairwise distances, and (2) modeling\n",
    "similar datapoints by means of small pairwise distances. Moreover, as\n",
    "a result of these characteristics of the t-SNE cost function (and as a\n",
    "result of the approximate scale invariance of the Student\n",
    "t-distribution), the optimization of the t-SNE cost function is much\n",
    "easier than the optimization of the cost functions of SNE and\n",
    "UNI-SNE. Specifically, t-SNE introduces long-range forces in the\n",
    "low-dimensional map that can pull back together two (clusters of)\n",
    "similar points that get separated early on in the optimization. SNE\n",
    "and UNI-SNE do not have such long-range forces, as a result of which\n",
    "SNE and UNI-SNE need to use simulated annealing to obtain reasonable\n",
    "solutions. Instead, the long-range forces in t-SNE facilitate the\n",

    "## Optimization methods for t-SNE {#sec-optimization_methods_for_tsne}\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by presenting a relatively simple, gradient descent procedure for\n",
    "optimizing the t-SNE cost function. This simple procedure uses a momentum term\n",
    "to reduce the number of iterations required and it works best if the momentum\n",
    "term is small until the map points have become moderately well organized.\n",
    "Pseudocode for this simple algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1 (FIXME: ref not working). The\n",
    "simple algorithm can be sped up using the adaptive learning rate scheme that\n",
    "is described by @jacobs:rates, which gradually increases the learning\n",
    "rate in directions in which the gradient is stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the simple algorithm produces visualizations that are often much\n",
    "better than those produced by other non-parametric dimensionality reduction\n",
    "techniques, the results can be improved further by using either of two tricks.\n",
    "The first trick, which we call \"early compression,\" is to force the map points\n",
    "to stay close together at the start of the optimization. When the distances\n",
    "between map points are small, it is easy for clusters to move through one\n",
    "another so it is much easier to explore the space of possible global\n",
    "organizations of the data. Early compression is implemented by adding an\n",
    "additional L2-penalty to the cost function that is proportional to the sum of\n",
    "squared distances of the map points from the origin. The magnitude of this\n",
    "penalty term and the iteration at which it is removed are set by hand, but the\n",
    "behavior is fairly robust across variations in these two additional\n",
    "optimization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A less obvious way to improve the optimization, which we call \"early\n",
    "exaggeration,\" is to multiply all of the $p_{ij}$'s by, for example, 4, in the\n",
    "initial stages of the optimization. This means that almost all of the\n",
    "$q_{ij}$'s, which still add up to 1, are much too small to model their\n",
    "corresponding $p_{ij}$'s. As a result, the optimization is encouraged to focus\n",
    "on modeling the large $p_{ij}$'s by fairly large $q {ij}$'s. The effect is\n",
    "that the natural clusters in the data tend to form tight widely separated\n",
    "clusters in the map. This creates a lot of relatively empty space in the map,\n",
    "which makes it much easier for the clusters to move around relative to one\n",
    "another in order to find a good global organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all the visualizations presented in this paper and in the\n",
    "supporting material, we used exactly the same optimization\n",
    "procedure. We used the early exaggeration method with an exaggeration\n",
    "of 4 for the first 50 iterations (note that early exaggeration is not\n",
    "included in the pseudocode in Algorithm 1). The number of\n",
    "gradient descent iterations $T$ was set 1000, and the momentum term\n",
    "was set to $\\alpha^{(t)} = 0.5$ for $t<250$ and $\\alpha^{(t)}=0.8$ for\n",
    "$t \\geq 250$. The learning rate $\\eta$ is initially set to 100 and it\n",

    "1. *Dimensionality reduction for other purposes.* It is not obvious\n",
    "how t-SNE will perform on the more general task of dimensionality\n",
    "reduction (i.e., when the dimensionality of the data is not reduced to\n",
    "two or three, but to $d > 3$ dimensions). To simplify evaluation issues,\n",
    "this paper only considers the use of t-SNE for data visualization. The\n",
    "behavior of t-SNE when reducing data to two or three dimensions cannot\n",
    "readily be extrapolated to $d > 3$ dimensions because of the heavy tails\n",

    "tails comprise a relatively large portion of the probability mass\n",
    "under the Student-t distribution, which might lead to d-dimensional\n",
    "data representations that do not preserve the local structure of the\n",

    "needs to be reduced to a dimensionality higher than three, Student\n",
    "t-distributions with more than one degree of freedom10 are likely to\n",
    "be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Curse of intrinsic dimensionality.* t-SNE reduces the\n",
    "dimensionality of data mainly based on local properties of the data,\n",
    "which makes t-SNE sensitive to the curse of the intrinsic\n",
    "dimensionality of the data @bengio:learning. In data sets with\n",

    "LLE suffer from exactly the same problems (see, e.g.,\n",

    "classical scaling, Isomap, LLE, and diffusion maps) is the convexity\n",
